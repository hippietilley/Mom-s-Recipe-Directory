    6-8 cups Crisco shortening (enough to fill your deep fryer)

Method
  1. Mix all spices together and grind for 3-4 minutes.
  2. Add 2-3 Tablespoons of spice mixture to the flour, mix well. Set aside
	1/2 cup of flour/spice mixture. This will be used for the first flour
	dip.
  3. Mix the brine, add the chicken and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.
  4. Dry chicken with paper towels. Mix the egg wash.
  5. Dredge all chicken in the 1/2 cup four mixture, shaking off excess. Add any 
	remaining flour mixture to the other flour bowl.
  6. Dip chicken in the egg wash, allow excess to drip off.
  7. Dredge chicken in the second flour bowl one at a time. Lay chicken on a rack
	and let dry for at least 30 minutes.
  8. Heat oil to 350°F. Gently add chicken to oil, 1 piece at a time. Do not add more
	than 3 pieces total to fryer. Fry for 12-15 minutes, or until chicken is 
	throughly cooked. Drain chicken and keep in a warm oven until serving.

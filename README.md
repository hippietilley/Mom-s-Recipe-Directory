# Mom-s-Recipe-Directory
This is a public, on-going archive of my mother's recipes
Feel free to commit recipes, but make sure to follow the below format

<Name of Recipe>
<space>
<Indgredient List>
  <amount of ingredient>
<space>
<Method>
  <steps labeled 1., 2., etc.>
<credits, if applicable>

Also be sure to end lines so that no horizontal scrolling is needed to 
read the entire recipe because that is just annoying.
